# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

For this project I was provided with three files - index.html, style.css, script.js, along with an image depicting the html file in a browser.
The HTML and CSS files were already filled out, while the script had a basic skeleton which I had to fill out.

The intent was to allow a user to generate a password of 8 - 128 characters in length, and allow them to choose whether to incorporate lower case, upper case, numeral, or symbol characters. This required the use of arrays to store sets of options, along with several conditionals and loops for both ensuring valid user input and generating the result.
Though I was able to leverage some prior experience with Java (not JavaScript) to hammer out a basic structure of the while and for loops, the random selection of a character type from those chosen by the user gave some trouble.
